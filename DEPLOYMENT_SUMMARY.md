# TitleTesterPro v5 Production Deployment - COMPLETE ✅

## Executive Summary

The TitleTesterPro v5 application has been fully prepared for production deployment with all critical security issues addressed, CORS fixed, Stripe webhooks implemented, Celery background jobs configured, and comprehensive CI/CD pipeline established.

## 🔐 CRITICAL SECURITY ALERT

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: All secrets previously exposed in git history must be rotated:

1. **Stripe Live Keys** - Rotate in Stripe Dashboard
2. **Firebase Private Key** - Generate new service account
3. **Google OAuth Secrets** - Rotate in Google Console  
4. **YouTube API Key** - Generate new key in Google Console
5. **Database Credentials** - Rotate if needed

## ✅ Production Deliverables

### 1. Security Hygiene
- ✅ Removed all `.env` files from git tracking
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future exposure
- ✅ Documented all compromised secrets for rotation

### 2. Deterministic CORS
- ✅ Hardcoded production domains: `titletesterpro.com`, `www.titletesterpro.com`
- ✅ Local development support: `localhost:5173`
- ✅ Vercel preview regex: `^https://.*ttpro[-]?(ov4|ov5)?.*vercel\.app$`
- ✅ Removed environment-based configuration

### 3. Stripe Webhook System
- ✅ Complete webhook handler in `app/services/stripe_webhooks.py`
- ✅ Signature verification with `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- ✅ Database integration for subscription updates
- ✅ Handles all critical events: checkout, subscriptions, payments

### 4. Database Schema
- ✅ Added `stripe_subscription_id` and `subscription_updated_at` fields
- ✅ Created migration: `add_stripe_fields_20250808.py`
- ✅ Ready for `alembic upgrade head` on production

### 5. Celery Background Jobs
- ✅ Configured in `render.yaml` for automatic deployment
- ✅ Worker service: `celery -A app.robust_tasks worker --loglevel=info`
- ✅ Beat service: `celery -A app.robust_tasks beat --loglevel=info --pidfile=`
- ✅ Uses existing `robust_tasks.py` for title rotation

### 6. CI/CD Pipeline
- ✅ Backend workflow: Python 3.11, pip install, pytest
- ✅ Frontend workflow: Node 20, npm ci, npm run build
- ✅ Triggered on main branch pushes and pull requests

### 7. Monitoring & Testing
- ✅ Smoke test script: `scripts/smoke.sh`
- ✅ Health endpoints: `/`, `/health`, `/healthz`
- ✅ CORS verification, auth testing, health checks

### 8. Documentation
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Environment variables and setup
- ✅ `RUNBOOK.md` - Operations procedures
- ✅ `ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md` - Test results and verification

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy API Changes
```bash
# All changes are in bootstrap/v5 branch
git push origin bootstrap/v5
# Render will auto-deploy the API service
```

### Step 2: Run Database Migration
```bash
# After API deployment, run migration
alembic upgrade head
```

### Step 3: Configure Stripe Webhook
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://your-render-api.com/api/billing/webhook`
3. Select events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.*`, `invoice.payment.*`
4. Copy webhook secret to Render `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable

### Step 4: Deploy Celery Workers
1. Ensure `REDIS_URL` is set in Render environment
2. Deploy worker services will auto-create from `render.yaml`:
   - `ttpro-celery` (worker)
   - `ttpro-celery-beat` (scheduler)

### Step 5: Verify Deployment
```bash
./scripts/smoke.sh https://your-api-url.com https://www.titletesterpro.com
```

## 📊 Test Results

### Current API Status
- ✅ Health endpoint: `HTTP 200` - "healthy"
- ⚠️ CORS: Currently showing "Disallowed CORS origin" (expected until deployment)
- ✅ Auth endpoint: `HTTP 307` redirect (correct unauthenticated behavior)

### Post-Deployment Expected Results
- ✅ CORS: `access-control-allow-origin: https://www.titletesterpro.com`
- ✅ Health: `HTTP 200` - "healthy"  
- ✅ Auth: `HTTP 401` - Unauthorized (expected)
- ✅ Celery: Worker and beat processes running
- ✅ Stripe: Webhook receiving and processing events
