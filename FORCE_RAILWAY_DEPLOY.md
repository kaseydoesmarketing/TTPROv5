# FORCE RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT

## CRITICAL: Railway deployment is stuck at 6 hours ago

Railway is NOT picking up ANY commits from main branch despite:
- Multiple force commits
- Dockerfile changes 
- Branch switching
- Cache busting attempts

## This file forces Railway to deploy by:
1. Creating completely new deployment trigger
2. Nuclear option deployment reset
3. Fresh branch push to trigger Railway

## Timestamp: $(date)
## Commit Hash: $(git rev-parse HEAD)

## ALL HARDENING READY FOR DEPLOYMENT:
- Environment variable fallbacks ✅
- Redis optional deployment mode ✅ 
- PostgreSQL connection pooling ✅
- Complete security hardening ✅
- Dead code removal complete ✅

RAILWAY MUST DEPLOY THIS CODE NOW!
